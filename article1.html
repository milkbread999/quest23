        <h2>Elaine Salinger on Solutions that Work & The Importance of Climate Hope</h2>
        <p class="info">March 28th, 2023 • By LEAFY GREENS</p>
    <div class="story">
        <p>As dire headlines about the climate crisis flood our news feeds every day, many of us are left feeling powerless and hopeless for the future. Recent news coverage about the environment is effective at evoking a sense of doom about the future but more often than not this doom shuts us down instead of encouraging us to take action. According to a 2020 survey conducted by the Center for Climate Change Communication, over 40% of Americans feel “helpless” in the face of climate change. Is this helplessness exacerbated by the media? And if so, what can we really do to save ourselves—and the planet—from the effects of rampant climate despair?</p>
        <p>To gain a better perspective on this issue, I sat down to talk with Elaine Salinger, someone who resists the “doom-and-gloom” mindset that news coverage instills in us and empowers individuals to address climate change in their own communities. Elaine organizes the San Mateo branch of the Citizens’ Climate Lobby—a nonprofit organization that works to mobilize citizens to act against climate change—and she is deeply passionate about conservation. I first met Elaine when she delivered a presentation on climate action at my school, and I was immediately drawn to her work. I’m so glad to have had the opportunity to talk with her, and I’m sure that readers will take away as much from this conversation as I was able to. </p>
        <p><strong>AJ:</strong> Hi, Elaine, thank you so much for letting me interview you! I’m so ready to learn more about climate solutions.</p>
        <p><strong>ES:</strong> No problem, I’m so glad that you reached out.</p>
        <p><strong>AJ:</strong> So, tell me about yourself. What do you enjoy doing? What are some of the things you value?</p>
        <p><strong>ES:</strong> I’m a retired veterinarian. I had a veterinary hospital specializing in small animals, and now I’m trying to have some fun and make the world a better place. I don’t know many people who work full-time on climate action, but that’s what I’m doing right now. When you’re really dedicating a lot of your time to a cause like climate, it’s common to experience burnout, and making it a consistent habit to connect and be at peace with nature really eases that. I have a rigorous schedule in which I spend at least two hours every day outdoors enjoying nature, and I find that this is extremely rewarding.</p>
        <p><strong>AJ:</strong> That’s awesome! As someone who is part of Gen Z, which is kind of notorious for being chronically online, this especially resonates with me. I think a big reason why people don’t feel motivated to act on climate change is because they feel disconnected from nature, which is a big problem</p>
        <p>On that note, what motivates <em>you</em> to take climate action? </p>
        <p><strong>ES:</strong> Oh my god, I might cry. I deeply love the natural world, and it’s heartbreaking to me that we might lose all that we love. There are so many—<em>so many</em>—people and animals that have to live in pain because of our actions. We need to do something about this crisis before it causes even more suffering, and I believe that we <em>can</em> make a change through quick and effective actions.</p>
        <p><strong>AJ:</strong> I completely agree with you. It’s really sad to see the impact that human actions are having on the planet, and I’m so glad that people like you are so dedicated to making our environment a better place. </p>
        <p>I know that you do a lot of outreach with youth, high school students in particular. How are you able to motivate people to take action? What works?</p>
        <p><strong>ES:</strong> Usually when people give presentations about climate change, most people watch them, understand them, and that’s it. They don’t know what to <em>do</em> with the information. What has worked recently is telling people to not just leave and do nothing with the information. I tell people to join an organization that has tools to make action easy, because it’s collective action that works, it’s not just you and me as individuals. I give them quick, 2-minute climate actions that they can take, such as writing to representatives. I think that that passionate plea to please act, along with the easy call to action, is what people respond to.</p>
        <p><strong>AJ:</strong> For sure! So, what do you think are some barriers to climate action that people experience? </p>
        <p><strong>ES:</strong> Most people are so stuck in their habits, and their comfort level with the subject. maybe they don’t want to face it. It's just too uncomfortable. The reason I send out the 2-minute climate action emails is that when people build action into their habits, they actually take more of it. Another factor is that everyone is worried, but they don’t know what to do. Honestly, our brains are lazy. Evolution has programmed them to respond to immediate issues and immediate crises that are right in front of us. They weren’t created to respond to a slow moving thing that you see miles away, but you don’t ever think it’s actually going to affect you.</p>
        <p> This is all about delayed gratification. It is possible to get people to act, what’s needed is that people need to hear about solutions that work and what they can do. Why isn't the media covering the big solutions? They’re not covering what people can really do, and focusing on making people feel guilty for their own actions. When you read articles in major media and listen to the radio, it’s all the doom and gloom. It’s all the statistics about how bad it’s getting, that’s what is covered, and that does not motivate people to take action. </p>
        <p><strong>AJ:</strong> That’s such an important point. I’m so glad that you’re working to make climate action easier and more accessible for people, especially when the media tends to focus on the negative aspects of climate change, which can make people feel helpless and overwhelmed. So, what would you consider to be your favorite climate solution? </p>
        <p><strong>ES:</strong> My all-time favorite climate solution is definitely the price on carbon of over €100 per ton that the UK and EU have. A higher price on carbon will <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/price-on-carbon/">significantly decrease the amount of carbon emissions.</a> It encourages companies to transition away from fossil fuels because it uses tangible, monetary incentives. This short-term incentive is a big reason why carbon prices are so effective. They’re also doing a border adjustment later this year, which is really going to push the buttons of American policymakers.</p>
        <p><strong>AJ:</strong> That’s so true. You previously talked about how we have trouble processing long-term threats, and carbon pricing really provides a short-term motivation, which is more salient. You also mentioned a border adjustment. Do you mind telling me a bit more about that? </p>
        <p><strong>ES:</strong> Of course. A border adjustment is this: let's say a company in Europe is manufacturing a product. In Europe, the company has to pay for its carbon emissions through carbon pricing policies, which increase its production costs. So, when they export goods to the US, if they just mark them up the way they normally would, the product will be less competitive compared to a similar product manufactured in the US where there is no carbon pricing. In a border adjustment, the EU will give the European company cash back so that they’ll be on parity with goods that’ll be made in the US. The same is true when they’re importing goods, the price is adjusted upwards so that it is in parity with the goods in the EU.</p>
        <p><strong>AJ:</strong> I see. This adjustment basically makes it so companies aren't penalized or given an unfair advantage based on where they're located in terms of carbon pricing policies. Border adjustments are also really important because they use profit incentives to discourage companies from relocating to countries with more chill environmental regulations, which is another reason why these adjustments are really effective at decreasing emissions.  </p>
        <p>So, as we wrap up, do you have any advice for individuals who want to take action on climate change?</p>
        <p><strong>ES:</strong> Along with improving our own lifestyles, there are two main areas of action that are really effective. We can raise awareness about climate change and we can really get involved in climate advocacy.</p>
        <p>To raise awareness, you can start by educating ourselves about climate change and possible solutions. The <a href="https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=23.2.1">En-ROADS simulation</a>, which I use in my presentations, is really helpful for visualizing the effects of different climate solutions on our future. Then, you can share these resources with our friends, family, and community. It’s also really important, especially for youth, to express your thoughts and feelings about climate change. Team up with others who share your passion to write for local newspapers. You can give perspectives for local radio stations. We need to educate the public about what works and what they can do. This is so needed, because without a groundswell of people wanting climate action, action will not happen.</p>
        <p>Getting involved is also very, very big. Contact legislators about what needs to be done for climate. Talk to friends and family who live in red districts and tell them to write to their representatives. Through climate interest groups, you can speak at city council meetings and get cities to adopt policies like <a href="https://localenergycodes.com/">reach codes</a>, which are local building codes to get oil and gas out of our buildings.</p>
        <p>Organization works. A year and a half ago in the Senate Build Back Better Bill, there was a price on carbon, a rebate to make it socially just, and a border adjustment. It was on the docket because over 20,000 Citizens’ Climate Lobby members reached out to legislators, and the only reason these climate reforms didn’t pass was because of a <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3560404-manchin-will-not-support-climate-spending-in-reconciliation-package-reports/">single senator</a>. There is support, and we can do this. Legislation is our collective action. It’s what we need.
        </p>
        <p><strong>AJ:</strong>Thank you so much, Elaine! This was so powerful, and I really appreciate all that you’re doing to help protect our planet.</p>
        <p><strong>ES:</strong>Thank you! It was a pleasure getting to talk to you about this, and I’m so glad that you’re interested in climate action. </p>
